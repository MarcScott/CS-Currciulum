When developer write code, sometimes their programs need to repeat the same chunks of code over and over again. Programming languages help developers with this by allowing the use of **Functions**. 
- The definition we use is, "A Function is a piece of code which performs a task, and returns a value". 
- Let's look at an example.

- I'd like to draw this pattern...
[[./img/pattern1.png]]
- In order to do this, I need to start by drawing a square...
[[./img/pattern1a.png]]
- Then rotating the turtle 45 degrees
[[./img/pattern1b.png]]
- draw another square...
[[./img/pattern1c.png]]
- Turn another 45 degrees
[[./img/pattern1d.png]]
- and again...
[[./img/pattern1e.png]]

- And so on. If you think about it, what I'm essentially doing is saying
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Repeat the following 8 times:
    DRAW A SQUARE
    ROTATE THE TURTLE 45 degrees
#+END_EXAMPLE

- We can teach the computer how to draw squares (or anything else for that matter) by writing a function which contains the steps needed to perform that task.
- We're going to start by creating a function called drawsquare().

** Code It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: code
:END:

- Start a new Python program, and save it straight away. Call it "**Pattern.py**".
- Start with the usual code to set Python up for drawing graphics...

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
import turtle

def drawsquare(): # This is a function called drawsquare
    for myMoves in range(4):
        tess.forward(100)
        tess.left(360/4)
        
wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.bgcolor("white") 
wn.title("Func-y Town")

tess = turtle.Turtle()
tess.color("hotpink")
        
for myMoves in range(8):
    drawsquare()
    tess.left(45)
        
wn.mainloop()
#+END_EXAMPLE

- When you run this, it'll draw the pattern for you. 
- The def drawsquare(): line and the 3 lines that come after it are where we have declared (created) our function. We've said to Python that any time in the future when we write **drawsquare()**, we want a square drawing. 
- Change the 8 in the line: **for myMoves in range(8)** to something else.
- Change the 45 in **tess.left(45)** to something else. 
- Manipulate the code to draw this shape?
[[./img/pattern2.png]]

- Create a second function, which draws a triangle when it is called (used).
- Add one line of code to your program to produce this shape:
[[./img/pattern2a.png]]
- Write a program to make the shape below. It is made from 20 squares.
    - What angle will you need in between squares? 
    - A pattern with 4 squares would need 90 degrees between each one.
    - A pattern with 8 squares would need 45 degrees between each.
    - A pattern with 180 squares would need 2 degrees between each. 
    - Is there a relationship between the two numbers?
