Notes on the Little Man Computer Simulation

These files are Copyright 2014 Peter L Higginson (plh256@hotmail.com) and the original graphics
background is Copyright gcsecomputing.org.uk and used by permission of Mike Coley.

Both Mike and Peter give their permission for non-profit educational uses subject to the attribution
notices being retained (on the main graphics and in the help file). If you are using the simulation
for a class you may mount the files included in this zip on your server.

The file index.html contains a Piwik routine that reports loads. It is set not to use Cookies and so
user permission is not requested. Please email plh256@hotmail.com with the url of any servers
that host the code so that I can see what use is being made of the it. If you are mounting this
on a closed system where it will not work you may wish to remove this code.

The running JavaScript is compacted for efficiency and to make it harder to make changes without
my knowledge. The file test.zip contains the original commented sources (main.js and routines.js)
and test.html that runs with these files. You may use these for educational purposes (including
giving copies to students) but please do not put them on the public internet. (They need to be in
a directory with the graphics files and help.html to run.)

The zip also contains divide.txt that divides the first number given by the second one. Try 355/113 to
get PI to seven digits. The original came from Mike Coley and he suggested it not be made public
because it is a common student project. I made Mike's version restartable and changed his *10
from a loop to a linear piece of code.

Please let me know how you get on (and any bugs etc. you find).

Best wishes,
Peter
