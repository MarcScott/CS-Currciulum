## Counting in Base 10 (denary)

- The digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

## Counting past 9
- When we want to count past 9, we need to use multiple digits

## They mean the same thing though
- These numbers are the same, just represented in different bases

## Converting
- We can use these cards to help convert between the two
