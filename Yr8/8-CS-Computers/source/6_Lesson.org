- In the [[file:~/bournetocode/projects/8-CS-Computers/pages/5_Lesson.html][last lesson]] you saw how we can write bits of data to RAM.
- So if we have an address that is 8 bits in length we can write values up to 255 (11111111) to any given address in RAM.
- In reality, modern computers have far larger address spaces, and 64bit of data (and more) can be written to a single address.

:PROPERTIES:

- The bits that are written to an address are not always considered data though.
- Sometimes when a CPU is accessing RAM, the bits in an address represent an instruction rather than just a number.

- Below is a simulation of how a CPU can carry out instructions.
- For now, ignore the section on the left titled /Assembley Language Code/.
- The section titled /RAM/ is where we'll focus.
- When the program starts, the Program Counter is set to 0. The CPU then fetches an instruction from address 0
- After each instruction is executed, the program counter is increased by 1.
- This means the next address location is read.
- Sometimes an instruction can branch, meaning the program counter jumps to another address.

- Lets write a little program using these instructions and see what happens.
- Fill in the RAM with the instructions as shown in the table below:
| Address | Instruction | What it will do                             |
|---------+-------------+---------------------------------------------|
| <c>     | <c>         | <c>                                         |
| 00      | 901         | Take input and load it into the accumulator |
| 01      | 902         | Output the value from the accumulator       |
-It should look like this
- You /must/ hit =ENTER= after inputing each code into the RAM address.
[[file:img/LMC1.png]]
- Run your program by hitting the =RUN= button and see what it does.
- Watch the little Android. She'll tell you what is happening.
- If you want to run it again, you'll need to hit the =RESET=, or you can change the Program Counter to =0=

- Write down what happens when you run the simple program. You can use the list below as a start.
  1. The value in the =PROGRAM COUNTER= is sent to =ARITHMETIC UNIT= and to that address in RAM.
  2. The value in the =ARITHMETIC UNIT= is increased by 1 and sent back to the =PROGRAM COUNTER=
  3. The value at address 0 in RAM is sent to the the =INSTRUCTION REGISTER= and the =ADDRESS REGISTER=

- Let's try something a little more complicated now.
- Add these values into the RAM addresses and hit =RUN=

| 03      | 150         | Add the value in address 50 to the value in the accumulator |
| 04      | 902         | Output the value from the accumulator                       |

- Can you write a program that will subtract two numbers.
- So if the first value A is provided, then a second value B is provided, then A-B will be output.
- Try it with the first value entered of 10 and the second of 6, and make sure that 4 is output.

- [[http:en.wikipedia.org/Fibonacci_number][The Fibonacci Sequence]] can be produced by starting with two number 1s
=1,1=
- You then add these numbers to get the next value in the sequence.
=1,1,2=
- You can now add 1 + 2 to get the next.
=1,1,2,3=
- And keep going.
=1,1,2,3,5,8,13...=
- Can you write an LMC program that outputs the Fibonacci Squence.
- (/HINT/ the code 6 will reset the =PROGRAM COUNTER= to what ever address you like. For instance 600 will reset it to address 000)
