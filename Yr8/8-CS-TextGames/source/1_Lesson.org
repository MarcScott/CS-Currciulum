* Why text games?

- In the early days of computers, graphics were a rare thing.
- Most users interacted with their computers using a terminal, which was only capable of rendering text.
- Because of this, some of the earliest games ever made were purely text-based games, that only used ASCII characters.
[[file:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/17/Rogue_Screen_Shot_CAR.PNG]]
- To this day, many programmers still like to create text-based games. This is especially useful when trying out a knew language, as it let's the programmer play around with the logic of a programming language, without having to worry about the complicated world of rendering graphics.

- Imagine you were tasked with creating a computer game, but you could only display ASCII characters on the screen and only take ASCII characters as input.
- Look at this link [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_code_chart][ASCII LIST]]
- Create a list of three types of games that you could create and a short description for each one. By the end of this module, you might even be capable of creating one.

- [[file:doc/rogueClone.py][Download this file]] to your home folder.
- Double click it to open it up.
- You might need to resize the terminal on Windows - right click the top bar and choose properties

- This is a very simple (rogue-like) game that you can play. Use the W,A,S,D keys to control your movement (hitting return each time)
- You can move about the cave, kill monsters (A-G) and heal at shrines (?)
** Code It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: code
:END:
- Now open up the file in IDLE (or another text editor)
- Have a go at changing the layout of the caves in the first string that was declared. Then play the game.
** Badge It - Gold

- Have a read through the code of the game - you don't have to understand it all.
- Try and change the HitPoints to make the game easier/harder
- See if you can add an additional monster to the game
- Take a screenshot of the functions you changed.
** Badge It - Platinum

- Can you make any other changes to the game?
- Maybe you could make a second board appear when all the monsters are killed
- Perhaps you could add in a sword that the player can get to help increase the damage she does to the monsters
- Use your imagination and have a go - if you break the code too much, just download another copy
- Take screenshots of any functions you changed and use comments to explain what you have done.
