<li>Although people have long thought about the possibility of <i>Machines that could think</i>, the science of AI really started with Alan Turing, back in the 1950s
</li>
<li>Turing had devised a hypothetical machine called <i>The Turing Machine</i>, that was capable of performing extremely complicated computations.
</li>
<li>Turing devised a party game, called <i>The Imitation Game</i>. In the game, a man (A) and woman (B) would each go off to seperate rooms. They could then communicate with the guests at the party, but only through typed messages. The man and woman would try to convince the guests that they were the other.
</li>
<li>The game was invented only to introduce the second more interesting version.
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
We now ask the question, "What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace our original, "Can machines think?"
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Turing was arguing, that if a machine can convincingly trick a questioner into thinking it was a human, then it can be classified as intelligent. Or more philosophically- what is the difference between a human and a computer that is indestinguishable from a human?

</li>
<li>In 1966, Joseph Weizenbaum created ELIZA, that appeared to pass the Turing test.
</li>
<li>Weizenbaum's program was able to fool some people into believing that they were talking to a real person, with some subjects being "very hard to convince that ELIZA was not human.

<li>Write up your opinions on ELIZA. Do you think it passes the Turing Test? Can you figure out the rules that dictates ELIZA's responses.

<li>Reversing <i>The Turing Test</i> has become a focus for research over the past few years.
</li>
<li>This means inventing a test that only a human can pass, and computers will always fail.

<li>The most common form of reverese test, of which you will probably be familiar is CAPTCHA

<li>The idea behind CAPTCHA is to present to the user an image that a computer would not be able to understand.

<li>Without CAPTCHA it would be trivial to design a bot that could register a billion different online email addresses that could be used to send spam, for instance.
