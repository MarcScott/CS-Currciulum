<p>
You car is driving at a moderate speed down a road. It turns a corner and there are five pedestrians standing in the road. Even if the car were to apply it's brakes, it would still hit them, so the only way to avoid killing the pedestrians is to mount the pavement. Unfortunately there is a single pedestrian standing on the pavement, who will be killed if the car chooses to swerve.
