- Although people have long thought about the possibility of /Machines that could think/, the science of AI really started with Alan Turing, back in the 1950s
- Turing had devised a hypothetical machine called /The Turing Machine/, that was capable of performing extremely complicated computations.
- Turing devised a party game, called /The Imitation Game/. In the game, a man (A) and woman (B) would each go off to seperate rooms. They could then communicate with the guests at the party, but only through typed messages. The man and woman would try to convince the guests that they were the other.
- The game was invented only to introduce the second more interesting version.
#+begin_quote
We now ask the question, "What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace our original, "Can machines think?"
#+end_quote
- Turing was arguing, that if a machine can convincingly trick a questioner into thinking it was a human, then it can be classified as intelligent. Or more philosophically- what is the difference between a human and a computer that is indestinguishable from a human?

- Go to this address http://www.masswerk.at/eliza/ and have a play around with ELIZA
- In 1966, Joseph Weizenbaum created ELIZA, that appeared to pass the Turing test.
- Weizenbaum's program was able to fool some people into believing that they were talking to a real person, with some subjects being "very hard to convince that ELIZA was not human.
- Write up your opinions on ELIZA. Do you think it passes the Turing Test? Can you figure out the rules that dictates ELIZA's responses.

- Although Turing never intended /The Turing Test/ to be a definitive test for Atrificial Intelligence, this has not stopped academics and companies holding competitions in which programs are subjected to /The Turing Test/.
- Use online resources to learn about some of these competitions and programs that have managed to fool interogators into thinking they were human.

- In your opinion, have there been any programs written that actually pass /The Turing Test/?
- Whether you agree or disagree that /The Turing Test/ has been passed, make sure that you justify your answer, and give examples of the programs.

- Reversing /The Turing Test/ has become a focus for research over the past few years.
- This means inventing a test that only a human can pass, and computers will always fail.
- The most common form of reverese test, of which you will probably be familiar is CAPTCHA
[[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Modern-captcha.jpg]]
- The idea behind CAPTCHA is to present to the user an image that a computer would not be able to understand.
- Without CAPTCHA it would be trivial to design a bot that could register a billion different online email addresses that could be used to send spam, for instance.

- There is now an interesting battle between bots and CAPTCHA programs.
- In fact, Google have been using CAPTCHA to train their AIs.
- Read[[http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22429992.400-googles-new-bottrap-trains-machines-to-see-the-world.html#.VRlKbLwo9QI][ this article]] to learn a little more.
- Ironically, these AIs that are trained are then capable of solving Google's own CAPTCHA.

- From a security point of view, what do you think the ramifications of computers being able to imitate humans succesfully.
- How might criminals be able to use these technologies?
- How might security expects be able to counter these technologies?
