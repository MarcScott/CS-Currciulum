* Using OpenStack
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
** Step 1 - Create and Instance
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- Go to http://cloud.bourne-grammar.lincs.sch.uk/horizon/
- Log in using your school credentials.
- On the left hand side of the screen you should see a menu where you can access your instances.
  [[file:img/instance.png]]
- Click on the button to launch a new instance
file:img/launch.png
- Use the form to setup your instance settings. Give your instance a sensible name of your own though.
[[file:img/instanceSettings.png]]
- Click on the Post-Creation tab
[[file:img/createScript.png]]
- Copy and paste the following code into Customization-Script box.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#cloud-config
password: mysecret
chpasswd: { expire: False }
ssh_pwauth: True
#+END_EXAMPLE
- Then click the Launch button
** Step 2 - Setup using the Cloud-Console
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:

- After a minute or two your instance will be ready to use
[[file:img/creating.png]]
- Click on the blue hyperlink to view your instance.
[[file:img/details.png]]
- From here you can access your instance via the terminal.
[[file:img/terminal.png]]
- If you can't seem to type in the terminal, click on the grey area of the screen.
- Your username will be =ubuntu= and your password will be =mysecret=
file:img/login.png
[[file:img/loggedin.png]]
** Step 2 - Settin up your account
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:


- You probably don't want the username =ubuntu= so let's add a new user account.
- Replace newUser with the username you want to use
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo adduser newUser
#+END_SRC
- You'll be prompted to give the user a UNIX password and enter some information.
- Next you'll want the new user to have sudo privaledges
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo adduser newUser sudo
#+END_SRC
- We can now switch to that user
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
exit
#+END_SRC- Next you'll want the new user to have sudo privaledges
- Now login as your newUser
- And navigate to your new =home=
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd ~/
#+END_SRC
- Let's delete the old user now, to lock down our instance a little.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo userdel -r ubuntu
#+END_SRC
** Step 2 - Setting up your software
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:


- First update and upgrade your instance
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
#+END_SRC
- Now we'll need a few packages. Emacs for writing text, cifs-utils for mounting windows drives and git for version control.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo apt-get install emacs24 cifs-utils git
#+END_SRC
- This one might take some time.
** Step 2 - Mounting Windows folders
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:


- You'll want to mount your Windows Home Folder securely.
- First we'll need to create a mount point
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo mkdir /media/windows
#+END_SRC
- First let's create a file to save your username and password.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
emacs ~/.smbcredentials
#+END_SRC
- This file will need two lines where myUserName and myPassword are your passwords to the *Windows Network*
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
username=myUserName
password=myPassword
#+END_SRC
- Save the file (=C-x C-s=) and quit Emacs (=C-x X-c=)
- Next we'll need to change the permissions on the file we've just created, so only you can see it.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
chmod 600 ~/.smbcredentials
#+END_SRC
- And next we'll need to edit a file called /etc/fstab so it knows where the *Windows Share* is
- Open it in emacs
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo emacs /etc/fstab
#+END_SRC
- Add this line to the bottom of the file
- Note the difference between your Linux and Windows username. Also note that you need a $ at the end of your Windows username.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
//brgras005/WindowsUserName$ /media/windows cifs credentials=/home/LinuxUserName/.smbcredentials,iocharset=utf8,sec=ntlm 0 0
#+END_SRC
- Let's make a symlink to the /media/window folder
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ln -s /media/windows ~/windows
#+END_SRC
- And now mount the drive
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo mount -a
#+END_SRC
