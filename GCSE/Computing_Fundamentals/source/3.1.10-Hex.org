You've already learned about Binary (base2) numbers, and why Computers use them.
Now let's look at another base - base16, called Hexadecimal
* Why not binary?

- Binary numbers are difficult for programmers to work with.
- If we're building a web-page, then chances are we're going to want to use colour.
- In general computers use the RGB colour model, where any colour we need is made up by additive mixing Red, Green and Blue.
- The value of RGB colours ranges from 0,0,0 up to 255,255,255.

- Convert each of the 3 digit denary numbers to binary, as see what you get.
- Do you think that writing the binary number for the colour would be convenient.

- Note down why it is that programmers don't like using binary in their code.
* Hexadecimal is easier

- Coders use Hexadecimal as it's easy to convert it to binary, but it is more succinct.
- When counting in Hexadecimal, we use the letters A-F after reaching 9.
- =0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F=
- Normally we would use a table to aid in the conversion.
| Binary | Hexadecimal | Decimal |
|--------+-------------+---------|
|   0000 |           0 |       0 |
|   0001 |           1 |       1 |
|   0010 |           2 |       2 |

|   0101 |           5 |       5 |
|   0110 |           6 |       6 |
|   0111 |           7 |       7 |
|   1000 |           8 |       8 |
|   1001 |           9 |       9 |

|   1100 |           C |      12 |
|   1101 |           D |      13 |

- We can take a binary number, such as 10101101.
- Split it up into nibbles - 1010 1101
- Convert each to Hex - AD

- Convert each of the binary numbers you worked out before, into their hex equivalents.
- Now go on line and look up the hex code you've calculated (place a # in front of the number in your search) and check it matches the colour on this web-page.

- With experience, you'll not need a table, as you'll come to recognise the hex equivalent for each nibble.
- However, if you don't have a conversion table or can't remember the values, you can convert between binary and hex, by using denary as a middle step.
- Lets start with the binary number =01011101=
- Split it into nibbles - =0101 1101=
- Convert to denary - =1*1 + 0*2 + 1*4 + 0*8= and = =1*1 + 0*2 + 1*4 + 1*8=
- So we get - =5= and =13=
- Now convert to Hex - =5= and =D=
- So the Hex is 5D

- Converting hex to binary is a fairly similar process. We just need to do the denary conversion in between.
- Take the number =9E=
- Split it up =9= and =E=
- Convert each to denary =9= and =14=
- Then convert each to binary =1*8 + 0*4 + 0*2 + 1*1= and =1*8 + 1*4 + 1*2 + 0*1=
- Which makes =1001= and =1110=
- Which together becomes =10011110=
