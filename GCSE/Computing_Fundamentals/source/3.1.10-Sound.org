* What is sound?

- A /sound/ is literally a vibration that travels through a medium than can be heard when it reaches an ear.
- Normally that medium would be air.
- The compression and rareification of air can be represented graphically as shown below.
[[file:img/sound.jpg]]
- The image from the oscilloscope shows a sound wave with varying amplitudes and frequencies.
- If we were to look at the /y/ values, then we would see that the sound wave is fundamentally analogue in nature.

- When we talk about sound, we often use the terms /volume/ and /pitch/.
- What do these terms actually mean with reference to a sound wave?
- Why would it be problematic to store analogue representations of sound on a computer?

- In order to store sound in a digital format, there are a few steps that need to be followed.

1. The sound must first be captured with an input device.
2. The sound is converted to an analogue electrical signal.
3. The electrical signal needs to be sampled.
4. The digital data can then be stored.

- Use online resources to find out how a microphone can capture vibrations in the air and convert them to an analogue electrical signal.
* Sampling

- Sampling is the process of turning an electrical analogue stream of data, into a digital stream of data.
- The process involves recording the amplitude of an electrical signal at set intervals, rounding the value and converting it to binary (typically 16 or 32 bits for sound).
- For sound, this sampling normally occurs 44100 times per second. We call this the /Sample Rate/ and it is normally expressed as 44.1kHz.
- The number of bits we use to store the data is known as the /Sample Depth/.
- Obviously, the higher the /Sample Rate/ and the larger the /bit depth/, the higher the quality of the resulting audio.

- The image above is a graphical representation of how an analogue electrical signal can be sampled and converted to an integer, ready for storing as a binary integer.

- There is a good reason that we tend not to sample sounds at a higher sample rate than 48kHz. It is to do with Nyquist's Theorem.
- Use online resources to make notes on what is stated in Nyquist's Theorem.

- Even when digitised, an audio track can have a huge file size, that makes it impractical to use.
- For this reason we use compression, to reduce the file sizes.
- There are two types of compression:
  - Lossless e.g. Dolby TrueHD
  - Lossy e.g. MP3
** Research It

- Find out what the difference between lossless and lossy compression are.
- Find out what the percentage compression can be achieved with audio files.
