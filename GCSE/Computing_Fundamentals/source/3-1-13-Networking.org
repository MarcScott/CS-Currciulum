- When two or more computers are connected together through a =communication medium=, allowing them to exchange data and share =resources=, we have a computer network.
- Often a computer network conforms to the =server= / =client= model.
- Let's define some of those terms:
  - =Communication Media= refers to the connection between computers. This could be standard copper cable (normally Cat5 or 6), Fibre Optic cable or Wireless Radio.
  - =Resources= are devices such as printers or storage devices, that computers on the network have shared access to.
  - =Servers= are just another computer. They may sometimes be very high-powered if the service they are providing is computationally hard (such as serving millions of web-pages or performing advanced modelling) or they can be tiny devices such as a Raspberry Pi (serving media over a home network).
  - =Clients= are computers that use the services provided by the server.

- There are many different ways of configuring a computer network. The three main =topologies= are
  - Bus

  - Ring

- When computers communicate with each other, they must be able to understand each other.
- For this reason, specific rules have been developed for how computers should communicate in different circumstances.
- These rules are called protocols, and different protocols are used in different situations.
- You'll learn more about this when we talk about the =client-server= model
