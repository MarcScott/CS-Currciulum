- Unlike RAM, secondary storage is a more permanent way of storing data.
- Secondary storage can be internal - such as a computer hard drive, or external - such as a memory stick.
- Internal storage is used to store a computer's operating system, software and user files.
- External storage is used for backing up data, transferring files, transporting files or as an extension to internal storage.

- There are three classes of secondary storage - Magnetic, Optical and Solid-State.
- Secondary storage sizes are measured in bytes.

|                                   |       |              |

*** Magnetic Storage
- A disk that contains iron particles.
- Particles can be arranged in one of two directions - representing 1 or 0
- The drive contains a /head/ that can read the direction of the particles and change the direction of the particles using an electromagnetic field.
- The disk is spun rapidly, and the head moves back and forth, reading different parts of the disk.
*** Optical Storage
- A disc that contains dents (pits) and flat spots (lands)
- A laser shone on the disc will not be reflected it if hits a pit. This represents a 0.
- The laser will reflect when it hits a land. This represents a 1.
- The disc is spun rapidly and the laser guided over different parts of the disc.
*** Solid State Storage
- These disks contain billions of transistors arranged to make memory cells.
- The cells can be set to allow current to flow (1) or not to flow (0)
- By detecting if current is flowing or not flowing through a particular cell, the 1 or 0 can be read.

- Arrange the following advantages and disadvantages into the tables below.
*** Advantages
- Fairly quick
- Easy to carry around
- Extremely fast read and write speeds
- Easy to use
- Large capacity
- Easily replaced or upgraded
- Can be used in many types of devices (not just computers)
- Long lasting (if cared for)
- No mechanical requirements
- Silent when used
- Very cheap per MB of data
- Light weight and small
- Use very little power
- Very cheap, and disposable
- Very durable even if dropped or knocked around
*** Disadvantages
- Contains moving parts that will eventually fail
- Limited storage capacity
- Can be noisy
- Easily broken if not protected
- Use a large amount of power
- Have read/write limits - a few 100000 times before cells become corrupt
- Require special drives to read
- Very expensive per MB of data
- Can be easily damaged if dropped or knocked around
- Fairly expensive per GB although price is rapidly dropping
- Easily damaged by scratching, heat and light
- Write speeds are slow, compared to read speeds.

- Magnetic Storage is used in Hard Drives and tape drives. Tape drives are often used for backing up large volumes of data.
- Optical Storage is used in CDs, DVDs and Blu-Ray.
- Solid State is used in Hard Drives, Memory Sticks and Flash memory cards.
