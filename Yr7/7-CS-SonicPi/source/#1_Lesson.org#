- Sonic Pi is an application that allows you to create music using code.
- In this project you'll learn how to use the techniques you have learned in Computer Science to generate music.
- If you want to access these resources from home and your have a Raspberry Pi, you'll find Sonic Pi is already installed. If you're on Windows or OSX then you can download and install Sonic Pi [[http://sonic-pi.net/][here]].
** Try It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- Open up Sonic Pi.
- You should see a screen that looks something like this.

- You can write your code in =Workspace 1=

- Try typing the following line.
#+begin_src python
play 48
#+end_src
- Now press =Alt= and the =r= key to run the code and make sure you have your headphones on.

:PROPERTIES:

:END:
- So that was a single note. Let's try playing some more.
#+begin_src python
play 48
play 52
play 55
#+end_src
- You'll notice that when you hit =Alt+r= this time, that the three notes play simultaneously.
- If we don't want that, and instead want to put a break in between the notes being played, we need to use the =sleep= function. This takes a time in seconds as an argument.
#+begin_src python
play 48
sleep 0.6
play 52
sleep 0.6
play 55
sleep 0.6
play 55
#+end_src
** Code It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: code
:END:
- Does that sound a little familiar?
- Let's add some simultaneous notes into it. As you saw earlier, if we don't use the =sleep= function then notes are played at the same time.
#+begin_src python
play 48
sleep 0.4
play 52

- Sounding good?
- Let's finish off the first bar of the the first four bars of The Blue Danube.
