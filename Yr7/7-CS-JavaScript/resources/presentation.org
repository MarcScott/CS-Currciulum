** Message Boxes
*** Alert
Alerts can contain strings or variables or a mix of both
#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
window.alert('A message goes here')
window.alert(anyVariableName)
window.alert('You can mix text and ' + variableNames)
#+END_SRC
*** Prompt
Prompts will ask the user for a response. Remember to store a prompt as a variable, and that it will always be a string.
#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
myVar = window.prompt('This allows the user to type in a string')
myNum = window.prompt("Even if they type numbers, they'll still be strings")
#+END_SRC
*** Confirms
Confirms will give the user a choice between OK and Cancel. These are then stored as a Boolean (see later on)
#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
choice = window.confirm('Choose OK or Cancel')
#+END_SRC
** Variables
** Strings
** Numbers
** Booleans
