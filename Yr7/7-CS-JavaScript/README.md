## Year 7 - Web Development - An Introduction to JavaScript

### Target year group or age

Key Stage 3 - Year 7

### Purpose of Module

The purpose of this module is to introduce students to their first text-based programming language, and a few key concepts in Computer Science
The module builds upon the student's experience writing HTML and CSS, by using JavaScipt in a familair environment.

### Knowledge and Skills

* I/O with JavaScript
* Variable decleration, assignment and reassignment
* Conditional statements
* Iteration
* Functions

### Cross-Curricula / Literacy / Numeracy
* There are numerous opportunities for developing numeracy  within the unit 
  - Lesson 1 asks the students to create an equation for calcualting the year an individual will reach 100
  - Lesson 2 requires students to use conditional statements to find correct answers to mathematical questions and present a score as a percentage
  - Lesson 3 looks at a mathematical solution for swapping variables
  - Lesson 6 looks at percentages with regard to counting the badges earned by a student.
* There are numerous opportunites for developing literacy within the unit
  - JavaScript requires syntactic precision which helps improve the students literacy skills
  - Within the quiz that students create, there are opportunites to develop literacy, with a focus on spelling, puntuation and grammar.
  
### Progression from this module

Web Development - Building games with JavaScript

### Example work

The conlcusion of the project, is to produce a Web Page for displaying digital badges that have been earned by the student.

|Operator  |Loop    |For      |Iteration  |
|Function  |DOM     |         |           |

### Self-assessment questions

1. _How many badges did I obtain?_
2. _What was the easiest thing to do in JavaScript?_
3. _What was the hardest thing to do in JavaScript?_
4. _What was the thing I enjoyed the most about this topic?_
5. _If I had to do this topic again, what would I do differently?_

### Homework

This module is self-paced. Students should continue to work on the problems both inside and outside of lessons.
Depending on lesson length, student ability and time spent outside of lessons, I have found that each activity takes the students between 1 and 2 hours to complete.

### [DfE Computing Curriculum mapping](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study)
* design, use and evaluate computational abstractions that model the state and behaviour of real-world problems and physical systems
* use two or more programming languages, at least one of which is textual, to solve a variety of computational problems; make appropriate use of data structures [for example, lists, tables or arrays]; design and develop modular programs that use procedures or functions

### [CaS Progression Pathways mapping](http://community.computingatschool.org.uk/resources/1692)
* Understands the difference between, and appropriately uses if and if, then and else statements. Uses a variable and relational operators within a loop to govern termination. Designs, writes and debugs modular programs using procedures. Knows that a procedure can be used to hide the detail with sub-solution (procedural abstraction).
