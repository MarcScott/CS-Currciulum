** What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a programming language used by web browsers to interact with the user, and alter the contents of web-pages.
JavaScript is present on almost every modern web-page.
Recently, people have started to use JavaScript outside of web-browsers, using platforms like Node.js
** Where do I write JavaScript?
Like any other programming language, JavaScript is nothing more than text.
You can write JavaScript using any text editor and save it as either a .js file or a .html file.
For now we're going to write JavaScript inside an HTML file. This will make it easy for us to see what is going on.
* Setting up an HTML page.
:PROPERTIES:

** Code It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: code
:END:
- Open up a text editor.
- Type in the following lines of code.

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<script type="text/javascript">
<!--DELETE THIS ENTIRE LINE AND AND YOUR CODE HERE IN THE NEXT SECTION-->
</script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
#+END_SRC
** Save It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: save
:END:
- Create a new directory to save your work in. Call it JavaScript.
- Save your file as FirstJS.html
- Don't forget the =.html= ending, or you won't be able to view the file.
** Run It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: run
:END:
- Find your file using your document browser.
- Open the file in a web browser.
- You should be presented with a blank screen.

** Try It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- Can you remember how to give you web-page a =<title>=? Give it a go using the =<title>= tag in the =<head>= of your page.
* Your first line of JavaScript
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
** Code It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: code
:END:
- Make sure all your code goes in-between the script tags. You'll need to delete the comment line that begins =<!--=
#+BEGIN_SRC html
<script type="text/javascript"> 
<!--DELETE THIS ENTIRE LINE AND YOUR CODE HERE IN THE NEXT SECTION-->
</script>
#+END_SRC
- Now add the following line of code, so that your file looks like this...
#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
<script type="text/javascript">
window.alert('Losers Click OK');
</script>
#+END_SRC
** Save It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: save
:END:
- Now save your file
** Run It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: run
:END:
- What happens now when you view your web-page in a browser?
** Try It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- Can you make the Alert Box say something else?
* Variables
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
** Code It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: code
:END:
- JavaScript uses variables to store data. To get ready to create some variables, delete the line of code you wrote between the =<script>= tags. (You'll be deleting a lot of code in this module, don't worry about it.)
- Now we'll declare a new variable. Type this code in between your script tags.
#+BEGIN_SRC html
var myPet;
#+END_SRC
- Now that we have declared a variable, we have to assign it to some data. The Internet is full of cats, so let's choose a cat's name. Add this line _below_ the variable declaration.
#+BEGIN_SRC html
myPet = 'Tiddles';
#+END_SRC
- You'll have probably noticed that each line seems to end with a =;=. The semi-colon is a way of telling the browser that you have finished with that instruction, and to move onto the next instruction. Now declare a new variable called =yourPet= and give it a name.
- We can now use our alert command from earlier. Add this line to your code.
#+BEGIN_SRC html
window.alert(myPet);
#+END_SRC
** Save It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: save
:END:
- Save your file.
** Run It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: run
:END:
Open your web-page in a web browser. What happens?
** Try It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- Can you declare a new variable called  =yourPet=?
- Give =yourPet= a name and use a =window.alert()= instruction to display the name on the screen.
- Can you change the order that =myPet= and =yourPet= are displayed.
* Strings
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
** Code It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: code
:END:
- Strings are sequences of characters, such as 'Cat' or "Lisa" or '123'. They are always surrounded by quotes. Edit your code from between your =<script>= tags so that it looks like the code below.
#+BEGIN_SRC html
var yourPet;
yourPet = window.prompt('What type of pet do you have');
window.alert("That's nice, I also have a " + yourPet);
#+END_SRC
- Can you explain why we have to use double quotes on the =That's nice, I also have a...= sentence?
** Save It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: save
:END:
- Save your file.
** Run It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: run
:END:
- What happens?
- How did you join the two strings =That's nice, I also have a= and the string stored in =yourPet=.
** Try It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- Can you make a second =prompt= box that asks for the pet's name? /(hint: you'll need another variable for this.)/
- Can you make a second =alert= box that uses the pet's name?
* Numbers
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
** Code It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: code
:END:
- Numbers can be used in calculations. Look at the example below. *THIS IS NOT CODE TO TYPE IN.* Try and work out what the answers to the questions are going to be..
#+BEGIN_SRC html
"10"+"5" = "105"
10 + 5 = 15
100 + 20 =
"100" + "20" =
50 + 50 = 
"50" + "50" =
#+END_SRC
- Remove your existing code and then type in the code shown below, between your =<script>= tags.
#+BEGIN_SRC html
var myNum = 6;
yourNum = window.prompt('Give me a number');
window.alert(myNum + yourNum);
#+END_SRC
** Save It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: save
:END:
** Run It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: run
:END:
- Load up your html file.
- Does the answer look correct to you?
- Can you explain what has happened.
** Code It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: code
:END:
- We need to change the /String/ that the user inputs into a /Number/. This is called /Type Conversion/. This is easy to do in JavaScript. Modify your code so it is the same as the code below.
#+BEGIN_SRC html
var myNum = 6;
yourNum = window.prompt('Give me a number');
yourNum = Number(yourNum);
window.alert(myNum + yourNum);
#+END_SRC
- the line =yourNum = Number(yourNum)= converts the string to a number.
** Save It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: save
:END:
** Run It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: run
:END:
- Load up your html file. Is it adding numbers correctly now?
** Try It:
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- Can you write a short program that does the following:
  - Ask for a number
  - Ask for a second number
  - Display the result of the two numbers added together.
- Can you modify the program so that it subtracts numbers, multiplies them, divides them?
* Booleans
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
** Code It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: code
:END:
- Booleans can either be =true= or =false=. They don't have quotes around them.
- Once again you'll want to delete your code from within the =<script>= tags. Then type in the lines of code below.
#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
var choice = window.confirm("Do you want to continue?");
window.alert(choice);
#+END_SRC
** Save It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: save
:END:
** Run It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: run
:END:
- Open your file in a web browser. What happens when you choose =OK=? How about when you choose =Cancel=?
** Code It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: code
:END:
- In the above example we used the =window.confirm()= message box to set the =var choice= to either True or False. You can do this yourself easily enough. Delete your code between the =<script>= tags and then type in the following lines
#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
  var hasPet = window.confirm("Do you have a pet? Click OK if you do");
  if (hasPet == true)
  {
      window.alert("That's nice.");
  }
  else
  {
      window.alert("Do you want to buy a dog?");
  };
#+END_SRC
- /Don't worry if you're not sure about the if... else and all the {}. This will all be explained in Activity 2/
** Try It:
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- Can you add to the code that you have just written, so that if the user of the application has a pet, it will ask what the name of the pet is?
* Badge It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
** Task

To earn your first *Blue JavaScript Badge*, complete the tasks below. Once you have finished, ask your teacher to check your app to make sure it runs correctly.
- Create a new file called Greeter.html
- Add in the standard html code that you need to start writing javascript. Next write code to do the following:
- Welcome the user to the app, using a =window.alert()= message box.
- Ask the user for their name using a =window.prompt()= message box and store the name as a variable.
- Output a message using =window.alert()= that says "Hey, my name is XXXXXXX too".
- Use a =window.prompt()= message box to ask the user how old they are and store their age as a variable.
- Convert the variable to a =number=
- Use a =window.alert()= box to display the message 'That means you will be 100 in the year ####' (/HINT: the calculation is 100 - age + current year/)
- Use a =window.confirm()= box to ask if the user would like to continue.
