- Children and Young adults have had access to the Internet for their entire lives.
- They spend considerable portions of their days (and nights) viewing the Web, talking on messaging apps, and playing online games.
- We still don't know whether this may turn out to cause have psychological or health problems in later life.

- Did you click =Submit=? Did you read the warning message?
- If so then you are probably not alone. We often click on buttons, fill in forms and accept terms and conditions without reading them.
- Often we don't even think about where that information goes or what the receiver will do with it.
- This is a prime example of unsafe behaviour. You should never share personal details online.
- There are a few simple measures you can take to ensure you stay safe.
- Have a watch of this video
