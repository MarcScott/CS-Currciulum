- Virtual pets were very common and popular a few years ago.
- Pets such as the [[http:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi][Tamagotchi]] were tiny computers with software on them that simulated a pet.
- The owner of the pet had to feed it and pet it otherwise the pet would die.
- You're going to be making your own virtual pet in Scratch.
** Research It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
- Use the web to find out some of the features that were common to most virtual pet games. A list has been started for you below:
  - Feeding
  - Petting
  - Scolding
* Killing our pet

[[file:img/Dead_cat.jpg]]
- Create a new Scratch project called =Virtual_LOL_Cat=
- No matter how good a gamer you are, your character always dies in the end. So that's the first thing we'll be setting up.

- We'll need a couple of images to begin with.
  - One to represent the living pet.
  - One to represent the dead pet.
- Here are the ones I'll be using, but you can make your own or go online and find ones that appeal to you.

** Code It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: code
:END:
Our first script is going to kill the pet, whenever the space bar is pressed. Killing the pet will actually just be a case of changing the sprite's costume.
1. Click on the Sprite1 costume.
2. Click on the Costumes tab
3. Delete the costumes you don't need.
4. Use the Upload button to add in the costumes for both you alive and dead pet.

** Code It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: code
:END:
Now we just need to make sure everything has a sensible name
1. Name *both* costumes
2. Name your Sprite
[[file:img/Costume_2.png]]
** Try It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
We now need to write a little script to kill the pet.
Look at the code below and see if you can assemble the script.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
when space key is pressed
say "You let me die!!!"
switch to DeadPet
wait 2 secs
stop all
#+END_EXAMPLE
** Run It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: run
:END:

- Run your script.
- When you hit the space key, the pet should die.
- The problem is that the pet stays dead.
** Try It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- We need a way of resetting the script.
- Try to code the following.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    When 'Green Flag' clicked
    Switch to Costume "AlivePet"
    Goto position x:0 y:-125               
#+END_EXAMPLE
- You might need to adjust the =y:= coordinate, depending on the size of the sprite you are using.
** Run It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: run
:END:

- Test your script to make sure it runs.
- Your pet should die when the space key is pressed, and then reset when you click the green flag
** Badge It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: badge
:END:

- The current pet death is a little undramatic.
- Try to make it a little bit more interesting.
- Could you add a little bit of animation into it?
- Could you add some sound effects?
- Could you have multiple costume changes?
