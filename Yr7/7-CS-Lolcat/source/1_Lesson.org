* An introduction to Scratch
[[file:img/GUI.png]]
Scratch is a programming language that can be used to make small programs and games. Above is the Graphical User Interface (GUI) for Scratch. A GUI is how the a user interacts with software.

- The Scratch GUI is split into 4 sections
- These are listed below
[[file:img/KEY.png]]
- The key areas are:
 1. The Blocks Palette
 2. The Scripts Area
 3. The Stage
 4. The Sprite List
** Code It

:END:
If you've used Scratch before and already have an account, then you can skip this section.
- Goto [[http://scratch.mit.edu][THIS LINK to the Scratch website]]
- Click on the =Join Scratch= button in the menu bar.
[[file:img/join.png]]
- Fill in the details required. Be sure to pick a username and password you will remember.
- You might need to use your teacher's email address when you register.
- Once you are logged in, click on the =Create= button in the menu bar.
[[file:img/create.png]]
- Now we can name our file. Call it =Practice Scripts=
[[file:img/title.png]]
- Scratch works by dragging blocks of code from the blocks palate into the script area. These blocks then can be stacked to create scripts.
- Let's make a simple Script. From the Blocks Palate, choose =Events=
[[file:img/Scripts_menu.png]]
- Now, click and drag the following block on to the Scripts Area.
[[file:img/Green_flag.png]]
- Next choose the =Looks= scripts from the menu.
- Click and drag the =say Hello! for 2 secs= block and snap it to the =When flag clicked= block.
[[file:img/Hello.png]] 
** Run It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: run
:END:
- To run our Scratch script, you just need to click on the =Green Flag= in the Stage area.
[[file:img/Hello2.png]]
** Badge It - Silver
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: badge
:END:
- Try changing what the cat says and how long it says it for.
[[file:img/Happeh.png]]
** Code It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: code
:END:
- Now let's try something a little more complicated.
- Delete your current script by picking it up and dragging it back to the Blocks Pallette.
- We're going to make the cat grow. You'll need to search through the Blocks Pallette to find the appropriate blocks, and build the script as it's shown below.
[[file:img/GROWIN.png]]
** Run It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: run
:END:
- Click on the =Green Flag= in the Stage area.
** Badge It - Gold
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: badge
:END:
- Try to change the script so that after the cat has grown, it says "IM SHRINKIN" and then returns to it's regular size.
- HINT: You can use negative numbers in Scratch.
** Badge It - Platinum
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: badge
:END:
- Try an experiment with getting the cat to move around.
- To get your platinum badge you need to make the cat move around in a large circle.
- You'll probably want to look into using a loop to achieve this.
