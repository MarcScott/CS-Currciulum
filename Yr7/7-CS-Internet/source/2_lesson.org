* URLs and Domain Names

Look at your browser's address bar. What ever is written there is the
URL of the page you are on.
What ever is written there /after/ the =http://www= but /before/ the first =/= is the domain name of the site you are on.
You'll be very familiar with some domain names like;
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    google.com
    facebook.com
    yahoo.com
    youtube.com
    wikipedia.org               
#+END_EXAMPLE

- There are lots of /Top Level Domains/ available to website owners.
- =.com=, =.org=, and =.co.uk= are just some of a few.
- Gather a list of 10 other Top Level Domains that are available.
** Present It
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
- Explain what a Top Level Domain is and give some examples for your notes.
* IP addresses

- Domain names are a little like addresses. For instance, the Prime Minister lives at:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    10 Downing Street
    London,
    SW1A 2AA                            
#+END_EXAMPLE
[[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/2010_Official_Downing_Street_pic.jpg]]
- This is nice and easy for humans to say and remember. 
- Another way of saying where the Prime Minister lives would be to use Longitude and Latitude.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    51° 30′ 12.23″ N, 0° 7′ 39.5″ W
#+END_EXAMPLE
- This is tricky for a human to remember but great for a computer. 
- Try copying and pasting it into [[http://maps.google.com][Google Maps]] and see what happens
----
- Domain names are like address, they are designed for humans to read and remember. In reality a computer's address (that allows other computers on a network or the internet to find it), is made up of numbers.
- Computer use =IP addresses= to send messages to each other.
- Your Computer's current IP address should be shown below
#+BEGIN_HTML
<div style="text-align:center;margin:0 auto;">
</br>                   
<script language="JavaScript">
VIH_BackColor = "#525252";
VIH_ForeColor = "#F0F0F0";
VIH_FontPix = "30";
VIH_DisplayFormat = "The IP address is of your current location is:</br> %%IP%%";
VIH_DisplayOnPage = "yes";
</script>

- We need domain names because *IP addresses are too difficult for humans to remember.*
- Imagine typing in this every time you needed to go to a certain web address.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    http://74.125.239.116
#+END_EXAMPLE
- Try these as well and write down the corresponding domains:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    1. http://212.58.246.90
    2. http://77.91.251.10
    3. http://72.21.210.29

- Answer the following questions in your notes.
  - What is a domain name?
  - What is an IP address?
  - Why do humans not use IP addresses?
* The DNS

- Below are three videos, each explaining DNS in a little more detail. You can watch just the first, or all three, but make sure you understand what DNS is.

- Imagine you had to explain DNS to somebody who had no idea what it was.
- Using whatever software you like (or even pen and paper if you prefer), create a product that you could use to help explain DNS to someone. You could create a poster, a presentation, a report. It's really up to you.
- You'll be awarded a bronze, silver or gold badge, depending on your teacher's assessment of your understanding of DNS.
