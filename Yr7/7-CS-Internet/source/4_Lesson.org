The internet is a very large network, but at the end of the day it is still just a network of computers.

* What is a Computer Network?
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
When ever we connect two or more computers together, so that they can communicate with each other, we have a Computer Network.

- There are many different types of network, with names like /mesh/,/bus/ and /ring/.
[[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/NetworkTopologies.png]]
- Most networks you will have used will have been /star/ networks.
- Star networks are named because of the shape they have in diagrams.
[[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/StarNetwork.svg/1200px-StarNetwork.svg.png]]
- Even though in reality they look more like this:

- With the cables tucked away out of sight and leading back to the central hub.

- The image below shows the devices that might make up a home network
- Download the image (right click on it), and then open it up in a graphics package such as Paint or Photoshop.

** Try It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- Now label the devices using the list below.
  - Desktop Computer
  - Smartphone
  - Router
  - Media Player
  - Games Console.
  - Notebook

- We can connect up devices on a network using cable called /Patch cables/. You've probably got one coming out of the back of the computer you are using right now.
- Patch cables are plugged into /Ethernet Ports/ on devices.
** Try It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- On your diagram, draw on wires that link the the Ethernet ports on the Desktop Computer, Media Player and Games Console to the Router

- Some devices connect wirelessly.
- /WiFi/ stands for Wireless Fidelity.
- /WiFi/ uses radio waves to allow devices to communicate with each other.
** Try It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- On your diagram, add in something to indicate that the Router is able to connect to the Smartphone and Notebook using /WiFi/.
** Research It

- Devices can connect with each other using a few other methods. Use the Web to try and answer the following questions:
  - What is /Bluetooth/?
  - What is the range of /Bluetooth/ communications
  - What are Fibre Optic cables?
  - What does 4G mean?

- Your diagram should probably look something like this now.
[[file:img/Home_network.jpg]]
- Let's imagine that the Desktop Computer is going to send an image file to the Media Player.
- The image is called tree.jpg and has a size of 1.5MB (That's 1.5 Million bytes)
[[file:img/tree.jpg]]
- 1.5 Million bytes is too large to send in one go, so the Desktop Computer needs to break up the file into small chunks called /packets/
- Each packet has an average size of about 1.5KB (That's 1500 bytes)
- The Desktop Computer breaks up the image into packets, and adds some extra data onto the packet as well
[[file:img/packet.jpg]]
- Each packet is then sent to the Router.
- When the Router receives a packet, it looks at the receiver's IP Address, and then sends the packet onto the correct device on the network.
- The receiving device (in this case the Media Player) receives all these packets, and uses the packet number to assemble them all in the correct order.
- Sometimes a packet get's lost or destroyed on the way. The receiving device will know that a packet is missing, and can use the sender's IP address to ask for the packet to be sent again.

* A Presentation on Networks

- Imagine you had to try and explain how an image is sent over a network, from one device to another.
- Create a presentation (using any software you like), and the image you drew earlier of a network, to explain how a file is sent over a network.
- Your teacher will award you a silver, gold or platinum badge, depending on the clarity of your presentation.
