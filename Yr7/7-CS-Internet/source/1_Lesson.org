- In reality, The Internet is a global network of computers, connected by /fibre optic/ and /copper cables/ or /wireless and satellite signals/.
- On it's own, the internet is nothing more than a lot of very expensive equipment.
** Research It
- Use online resources to find out a little bit about what /Fibre Optic/ cables are.
- Find out where the world's longest fibre optic cables can be found.

- Tim Berners-Lee invented the Web back in 1989.
- To understand how the Web works, we're going to create a little web-page.
  - Create a new directory somewhere in your directory. Call it =myWebsite=
** Code It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: code
:END:
- Open up a text editor.
- Now copy and paste the following into your document
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <html>
    <body>
        <h1>My First Webpage</h1>
        <p>This is my first webpage. I hope you enjoy it.</p>
        <img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_wide_web#mediaviewer/File:WorldWideWebAroundWikipedia.png" width="600px">
        <a href="secondpage.html">Link to my Second Page</a>
    </body>
    </html>             
#+END_EXAMPLE
** Save It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: save
:END:
- Save your file as =firstpage.html=
- The name is important - make sure it is all lowercase and that the file
ends in =.html= and /NOT/ =.txt=
** Code It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: code
:END:
- Now create a second document.
- Now copy and paste the following into your document
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <html>
    <body>
        <h1>My Second Webpage</h1>
        <p>This is my second webpage. I hope you enjoy it as much as the first.</p>
        <a href="firstpage.html">Link to my First Page</a>
        <a href="http://www.google.com">Link to Google</a>
    </body>
    </html>

:END:
- Now have a look inside the directory you created. You should see two icons for the two files that you created and both should look like web browser icons
- Double click the firstpage.html file and it should open up in a web-browser.
- Test that the links work.
- If the pages don't work, go back and look at them in your text editor, and make sure you have copied and pasted the code correctly. Also check that the names of the files are correct.
** Try It:
:PROPERTIES:

- Can you make a third web page by altering the code we've used in the other two?
** Research It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
- The world wide web is a collection of =html= documents, like the two that you created.
- They all link to each other using links like the ones you made.
- The =html= documents are stored on different computers all over the world.
- These computers are called /Web Servers/
