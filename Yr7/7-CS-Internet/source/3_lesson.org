- A Domain Name Server has a table stored on it, that will look something like this:
| Domain Name |     IP Address |
|-------------+----------------|
| google.com  | 74.125.239.116 |
| bbc.co.uk   |  212.58.246.90 |

A quick note. Not everything explained in this presentation is true. Some of it is a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie-to-children][simplification]] to make things easier to understand
** Code It
:PROPERTIES:

- We're going to have to build a DNS Table to begin with. This is going to be made up of two lists.
- In Scratch, create a new list called =Domain Names= and then another list called =IP Addresses=
[[file:img/Create_Lists_1.png]]
** Code It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: code
:END:
- We're going to need a few Domain names and IP Addresses to populate our table. About 1000 of each should do the trick.
- This would take ages by hand, but luckily Scratch allows us to import text files.
- Download this text file - [[file:../resources/domains.txt][Domains.txt]] and this text file - [[file:../resources/IPs.txt][IPs.txt]]
- Now right click on the gray box that represents the Domain Names list and choose import from the context menu.
- You can then direct your file browser to the downloaded file.
[[file:img/Create_Lists_2.png]]
- Do the same for the IP Addresses list and you should end up with something that looks like this.

:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
- When you type in a URL into a web-browser address bar, your computer consults the DNS server, to find the IP address.
- The DNS server has to look up the domain name and find the corresponding IP address
- To do this the server needs to use a searching algorithm.

On the image below you're presented with an Identity Parade Lineup. You need to find this face:

- Explain how you choose to find the correct face from the line up.
- Try and explain how you think a computer might have done it.
- How long do you think it would take you to find the IP address of a domain name in the list of 1001 you now have in Scratch?

:END:
- A linear search is a method of going through a list of items, one by one, and checking each item. 
- Imagine we had a list of 'things'
=[cat,dog,horse,mouse,rabbit,parrot,elephant]=
- If we wanted a computer to program to find the position of the element
=parrot= it would check from left to right
- The program would check what was at position 1, see if it was parrot and if it wasn't it would move onto position 2, and so on.
- Luckily, computers can do this exceptionally quickly.
* Indexing a list
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
** Learn It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- As a computer reads through a list, it needs to keep track of where it is. This is what an index is for.
- Imagine we have the following two lists:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    OperatingSystems = ['Mac OSX','Windows 8','Android','iOS','Ubuntu']
    Rating = ['4/5','2/5','4/5','3/5','5/5']
#+END_EXAMPLE
- The items in the first list are Operating systems.
- The items in the second list give a user rating out of 5.
- Imagine we wanted to find out the rating out of 5 for Android.
- We could step through the list of operating systems until we found Android.
- This would not tell us where to find the rating out of five in the second list though. It would just tell us that Android exists in the first list.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    OperatingSystems = ['Mac OSX','Windows 8','Android','iOS','Ubuntu']
    Rating = ['4/5','2/5','4/5','3/5','5/5']                 
#+END_EXAMPLE
- As we move through (iterate) the first list searching for 'Android', we keep a count of our position. The position is called the /index/ of the list.
- The algorithm looks something like this:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
1. index = 1
2. Is Android at index (position 1)
3. No, so add 1 to index
4. Is Android at index (position 2)
5. No, so add 1 to index.
6. Is Android at index (position 3)
7. Yes. So look up index of the second list
8. index (position 3) of the second list is 4/5
9. So Android has a rating of 4/5
#+END_EXAMPLE
* Using a linear search in our DNS.
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: activity
:END:
- In our Scratch program so far we have a list of domain names and a list of IP addresses.
- We need to be able to conduct a linear search on the list of domain names to find the index of any given name.
** Code It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: code
:END:
- Start by adding in a When =green flag= clicked block
[[file:img/Linear_Search_1.png]]
- Now we'll ask the user for the domain name they're looking for.
[[file:img/Linear_Search_2.png]]
- Next you'll need a couple of variables:
  - Create a variable called =domain=
  - Create a variable called =index=
[[file:img/Linear_Search_3.png]]
- You should set the domain to be the answer of the =ask= block and the index to be the integer =1=
[[file:img/Linear_search_4.png]]
** Code It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: code
:END:
- Our linear search algorithm could possibly need to search right to the end of the list. So we'll need to use a loop that keeps going until the index is at 1001.
[[file:img/Linear_Search_5.png]]
- Currently =index= is =1=. So the algorithm needs to check the 1st item in domain names, and see if it matches the domain that the user is looking for. We can do this with a conditional =if/else= inside the =repeat until= loop.
[[file:img/Linear_Search_6.png]]
- If the domain names do not match, then we want =index= to become =2=, and the algorithm to go back to the start of the loop.
[[file:img/Linear_Search_7.png]]
- If however there is a match, then we know that the index of the IPs list will contain the IP address we're looking for.
[[file:img/Linear_Search_8.png]]
** Run It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: run
:END:

- Pick some random domain names from the list and use your algorithm to search for their IP addresses.
- Once you have an IP address you can copy and paste it into your browser's URL bar, and you should get directed to the site
[[file:img/Linear_Search_9.png]]
- Not all of them will work however, as some sites use redirects and other trickery that will fool your browser.
** Document It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: document
:END:

- Use screen shots and some text to try to explain how your Linear Search algorithm works.

Here's a quick recap of what you've covered so far.
- Domain names are easy for humans to read and remember.
- Each domain name links to an IP address that computers use to send messages to each other.
- A Domain Name Server (DNS) stores a table of domain names and IP addresses.
- When you type in a URL, your computer asks the DNS what the IP address is for the domain name.
- An item in a list can be referenced by its position, which is called it's index.
- Linear search is one method of finding an element in a list.

:END:

- You're going to try an implement your own Linear Search program now.
- Create a Scratch program that:
   -  Uses two lists, one to store a Subject Name (e.g. Science) and the other to store a teacher's name.
   -  Allows a user to search for a Subject Name and returns the teacher of that subject
- Use any sprites you like.
- Make it return 'Not found" if a subject that doesn't exist is asked for.
